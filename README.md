Using Code Examples and Fair Use Laws
This book was written to help you learn to develop multiplayer games. In general, you may use the code and examples in this book in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission for reproducing a portion of the code. You don’t need to ask permission to write an app that uses large chunks of code. We would appreciate an acknowledgment or shout-out somewhere in your credits.

Now, on the other extreme, if games appear that exactly reproduce the examples from this book, we will be very disappointed. We will then contact your mother and grandmother and explain to them that you have been a bad developer. We don’t have issues with using the examples as a starting point, but take the app further; be original! Answering questions by citing this book or quoting examples does not require permission (but we would appreciate the citation).

We reserve all rights for selling or distributing the examples in any format provided in this book. If you are not sure if your use falls outside of the fair use laws, please feel free to contact us at: Sales@BurtonsMediaGroup.com.
